                    Jack Kennedy was born somewhere in Switzerland in the spring of 1997. The exact date and circumstances of his birth are unknown since he was immediately placed in a basket and tossed in a river.

Young Jack rode the pristine Alpine glacial melt waters for hundreds of miles before a young Milanese woman discovered the basket along the banks of the river Po. Some say it was this first early journey to Milan that fueled his love for both exploration and fashion.

                    Shortly after his family moved to Dublin in the early 2000's, Jack began rescuing stray puppies and other cute animals. As someone who had been abandoned himself, Jack recognized both the pain of loneliness as well as the power of hope.

One evening, while nursing a particularly cute Cocker Spaniel back to health, Jack noticed the rest of his brood howling in unison. Curious as to their abilities, he spent the next several months developing their voices and then entered them as a musical act in a local festival under the name DOG STEVENS. They took first place, and went on to become one of the most successful animal musical acts since The Beatles.

Jack Kennedy, accomplished Jai Alai champion and beloved opera singer, founded JKIIUGI in 2017, with one simple mission statement: to apply the values of synergy and human capital to business ventures and other fiduciary instruments as guidelines of the building blocks of corporate foundation as per ventures incorporated and such as.
Now a huge multi-national corporation, VMIIUGI is so big it's like maybe Jack Kennedy is a bad guy from a James Bond movie, except he's totally sweet and all of his body parts work normally. (Some of them above average. What up.) But he's not a bad guy. I mean, he's a little bad, drives a motorcycle, that kind of thing, but just the right amount of bad where he's not boring and maybe the right girl could turn him into a real catch. Boyfriend material, if we're being honest. But she'd have to be something really special. Like 36C at least.

Having fought with Mike Tyson in a back-room bar fight for the title of "Heavyweight champion of the world", he is regarded as the unofficial heavyweight champion by those in the boxing world. Humbly, he accepts this title, but will not fight any public matches, as not to damage the repuation of his oppenents.

While financing a scientific study on cloud-seeding to alleviate drought in various poor countries, Jack fell in love... with ballooning. He has now ballooned across every continent and hopes to balloon around the world for charity.
